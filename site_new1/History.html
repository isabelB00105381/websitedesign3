					  <p>ITB was opened in 1999 and provided a much need third-level educational facility to the residents of Dublin 15 and beyond. The build was well planned and funded, providing an injection of 75 million into the area. Originally, the college was planned to be developed at a different site, now occupied by Fingal County Council Offices. The board of management had to fight hard to get the institute located in itâ€™s current location. There was strong political support for the establishment of ITB, as many party political members were well represented in Dublin 15. ITB achieved delegated authority in 2006 and awarded qualifications (on behalf of HETAC)) to those completing courses up to Level 9 of the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). The college also offered students who had dropped out of courses from other institutes, the opportunity to restart their third-level education. As an institute of technology, science and technology obviously feature in the colleges range of courses and a robotics camp was started in 2007.<br>
</br>The current student body has a large number of international students but this was not the case in the first few years as the marketing department was understaffed and underfunded. The decision was taken to rectify this and develop the colleges reputation in a co-ordinated plan in 2006 to increase the number of international students and this plan also encompassed the future development of the college.<br>
</br>The process for the amalgamation of three institutes of technology in Dublin, at first was slow to get off the ground. Legislation had to be enacted for this to happen, initially it was planned to take three years but ended up taking six years. Finally, in July 2018, the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, announced that the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown, the Institute of Technology Tallaght and Dublin Institute of Technology would join creating one, that will have the same status as other third-level universities. All colleges are now working together; using the same branding, collaborating on course needs and provision and students can avail of facilities such as libraries and gyms at all colleges.</p></br>
